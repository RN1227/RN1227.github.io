    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dive <br>

    Two roads &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a yellow wood, <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rged <br>
    <br>
    And <em>sorry</em>  I could not travel <strong>both</strong>   <br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
    And looked down one as far as I could <br>
    To where it bent in the under<h1>growth;</h1> 
</p> 
<ul>
    <li>
        Then took the other, as just as fair,
    </li>
    <li>
        And having perhaps the better claim,
    </li>
    <li>
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
    </li>
    <li>
        Though as for that the passing there
    </li>
    <li>
        Had worn them really about the same,
    </li>
</ul>
<ol start="9999998">
    <li>And both that morning equally lay</li>
    <li>In leaves no step had trodden black.</li>
    <li>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</li>
    <li>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</li>
    <li>I doubted if I should ever come back.</li>
  </ol>








<em>
    I shall be telling this with a sigh
</em>
<br>
<small>
    Somewhere ages and ages hence:
</small>
<br>
<em>
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
</em>
<br>
<small>
    I took the one less traveled by,
</small>
<br>
<em>
    And that has made all the difference.
