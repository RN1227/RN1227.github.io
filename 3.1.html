        &nbsp;&nbsp;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;And sorry I could not travel both <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;And looked down one as far as I could <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br>
    </p>
    
    <p id ="para2">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Though as for that the passing there<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Had worn them really about the same,<br>
    </p>
    
    <p id="para3">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;And both that morning equally lay<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p id = "para4">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;I took the one less traveled by,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;And that has made all the difference.<br>
