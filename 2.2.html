<h1>

    <li> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br></li>   

    <li> And sorry I could not travel both <br> </li> 

    <li>And be one traveler, long I stood <br></li>  

   <li>And looked down one as far as I could <br></li>  

   <li>To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br> </li>  

    </ol>

    <ol type="I">
   
    <li> Then took the other, as just as fair, <br></li>   

    <li> And having perhaps the better claim, <br> </li> 

    <li>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br></li>  

   <li>Though as for that the passing there <br></li>  

   <li>Had worn them really about the same, <br> </li>  

    </ol>

<h3> 
    <ol type="1">
   
    <li> And both that morning equally lay <br></li>   

    <li> In leaves no step had trodden black. <br> </li> 

    <li>Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br></li>  

   <li>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br></li>  

   <li>I doubted if I should ever come back.<br> </li>  

    </ol>

<em> 
    <ol type="">
   
    <li> I shall be telling this with a sigh<br></li>   

    <li> Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br> </li> 

    <li>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br></li>  

   <li>I took the one less traveled by,<br></li>  

   <li>And that has made all the difference.<br> </li>
